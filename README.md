![N5 Classic](Screens/small/N5_Classic.png)

The differences between Material, Holo and Classic themes are easy to see.

### Galaxy S4

![S4 Devicedefault](Screens/small/S4_Devicedefault.png)
![S4 Classic](Screens/small/S4_Classic.png)

Notice the differances for the AppCompat theme. It's a mix of Holo and Material. For example RadioButton and CheckBox have the material style, but SeekBar and ProgressBar use the Holo Style. Also the ripple effect on buttons is not available with AppCompat.

The Devicedefault theme looks completely different the rest.
